# 🍷 Wine Quality Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the quality of wine using physicochemical properties. The goal is to build regression and classification models that accurately predict wine quality based on input features such as acidity, alcohol content, and more.

## 📈 Objective

To analyze and model the wine dataset to:
- Explore the distribution and correlation between features
- Predict wine quality scores using machine learning models
- Evaluate model performance using standard metrics

## 🗃 Dataset

- **Source**: [UCI Wine Quality Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality)
- **Records**: ~1600 wine samples
- **Features**:
  - Fixed Acidity, Volatile Acidity, Citric Acid
  - Residual Sugar, Chlorides, Free Sulfur Dioxide
  - Total Sulfur Dioxide, Density, pH, Sulphates, Alcohol
- **Target**: Wine quality score (0–10 scale)

## 🧪 Techniques Used

- Data Cleaning & EDA (using `pandas`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`)
- Feature Engineering (normalization, encoding if needed)
- Model Training using:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Evaluation: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report, ROC-AUC

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy, Pandas
- Seaborn, Matplotlib

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/wine-quality-prediction.git
cd wine-quality-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook WineQuality.ipynb
📊 Results
Best model achieved an accuracy of X% (update with your actual result).

Alcohol, Volatile Acidity, and Sulphates were among the most influential features.

📝 Future Work
Tune hyperparameters for improved model performance.

Implement a Flask or Streamlit web interface for real-time prediction.

Try deep learning models or AutoML tools.
